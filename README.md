# Description

Dotnet Runner allows the quick launch of a **dotnet** project without Visual Studio. Dotnet Runner also uses `dotnet watch` so that the application is automatically restarted when changes in the source code are detected.


# Installation

* Inside a **dotnet** project's root directory:
  * Copy `run-dev.ps1`
  * Copy `run-dev.cmd` 
* Open `run-dev.ps1` in a text editor and replace the variables at the top of the script as required.
* To launch the project, double-click `run-dev.cmd`.
